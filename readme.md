# README

This is a formatter for x86 assembly.

## Quick start

Run `make` to build the project in `src` directory. The out put executable will be `aformatter`.

Use comment `aformatter filenane` to format the file. The formatted form will be written to stdout; the original file will be overwritten. Backup file named `filename.bak` will be created.

## Appendum

This is a parser and formatter written entirely in C, conformant to C11 standard.

This project is still in pre-alpha stage. Many new features are planned and will be implemented in the future. (Including a full documentation)
